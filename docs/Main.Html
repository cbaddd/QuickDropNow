		<p id="Content_Copy">Blue Tape Society is a group for young artists and creatives. The Society’s mission is to help aspiring artists jump-start their careers through monthly galleries that will allow their work to gain exposure among the community, creating networking opportunities that will ultimately advance their careers. 
		So if you’re an aspiring artist, a lover of art, or just in town and itching to see what young artists in New York have to offer, come check out one of our student galleries.

 	<center><h1>About The Founder</h1></center>
	<center><img src="images/Belle.jpg" style="width:432px;height:260px;"></center>
		<p id="Content_Copy">My name is Belle, I’m a senior BA Art Major at Pace University, and the founder of Blue Tape Society. Blue Tape came out of the dilemma my friends and I were having with this digital art world. We were all making online websites and self-promotion, but did not have the experience or resume to be in galleries. Blue Tape brought a community from the digital into the real world, while giving aspiring artist a chance to show their world in a real world situation. I have always been interested in art ever since I was a kid. I enjoy working across mediums, but currently, I have been working with video and illustration. As well as going to school, I work as a graphic designer for Seidenberg School at Pace</p>
